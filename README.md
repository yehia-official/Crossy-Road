# 🧊 Three.js Cube Game

This is my first simple 3D game built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) — a fun and interactive experience inspired by the classic “cross the road” concept. Despite its simplicity, the journey was full of challenges and valuable lessons in web-based game development.

## 🎮 Game Idea

The core idea is simple: you control a cube trying to cross lanes filled with fast-moving cars and trucks. The road is split into multiple lanes, each with different types of obstacles or terrain (vehicles, forests, etc.). The goal is to move across as far as possible without getting hit.

## ✨ Why I Built This Game

I wanted to dive into 3D development for the web, and Three.js seemed like a perfect place to start. Instead of going for a heavy or complex project, I aimed for something lightweight, playful, and challenging at the same time. And it worked!

## 🧠 Challenges I Faced

- **Orthographic Camera Setup**: It was tricky to get the camera angles and distances right to make the scene look natural and clear.
- **Dynamic Lane & Object System**: I built a system to generate lanes dynamically, each with different behaviors. This helped me deeply understand the game rendering cycle.
- **Movement & Animation Sync**: Making object movement (cube, vehicles…) smooth and in-sync with animations — without any lag or glitches — was one of the hardest parts.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to work with **shadows** and **lighting** in 3D environments.
- Structuring my code in a **modular and flexible** way.
- Dealing with **performance optimization**, especially for interactive rendering.
- Understanding different camera types and how they affect visual composition.

## 🚀 The Outcome

After lots of trial and error, tweaking, and learning, I finally completed my first 3D game using Three.js. It’s a small milestone, but one that motivates me to keep learning and exploring more in the world of game development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- WebGL

## 📌 Notes

- The game is still basic and can be improved with sound effects or a point system.
- It performs well in the browser, but further optimizations are possible for future versions.
